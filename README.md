# Self Driving Car Simulation
Welcome to the Self-Driving Car Simulation project! This repository contains the source code for a 2D self-driving car simulation built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The project leverages neural networks to implement machine learning concepts, enabling the car to navigate a track autonomously.

# Overview
This project demonstrates the principles of self-driving cars and neural networks. It includes a visual representation of a car navigating a 2D track, where the car's behavior is controlled by a neural network trained through a simple machine learning algorithm.

# Features
2D Car Simulation: Visual representation of a self-driving car in a 2D environment.
Neural Network Integration: Use of neural networks to control the car's decision-making process.
Obstacle Avoidance: The car can detect and avoid obstacles on the track.
Dynamic Learning: The neural network learns and improves its performance over time.

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
A modern web browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
Basic knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

# Neural Network Details
The neural network in this project is a simple feedforward neural network with the following characteristics:

Input Layer: Takes sensor inputs from the car (e.g., distances to obstacles).
Hidden Layers: Contains neurons that process the inputs.
Output Layer: Determines the car's actions (e.g., turn left, turn right, accelerate).

## Training Process
The neural network is trained using a basic reinforcement learning algorithm. The car's performance improves based on feedback from the environment, such as avoiding obstacles and staying on the track.
